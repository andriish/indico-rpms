# There is some bootstrapping involved when upgrading Python 3

# Since babel 2.12, the pytz dependency is optional.
# However, pytz is preferred when installed.
# Running tests with pytz is optional as well.
# We don't want to pull pytz into ELN/RHEL just to test integration with it,
# but we don't want to ship babel in Fedora with an untested default,
# so we make the dependency conditional.
# Ideally, the dependency would be conditional on pytz availability in the repo,
# but that's not possible in 2023 yet.
# Additionally, the date/time tests require freezegun, which is unwanted in RHEL.

Babel is composed of two major parts:

* tools to build and work with gettext message catalogs

* a Python interface to the CLDR (Common Locale Data Repository),
  providing access to various locale display names, localized number
  and date formatting, etc.
