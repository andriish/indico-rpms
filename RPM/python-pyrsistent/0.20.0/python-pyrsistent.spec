# Replace _PyList_Extend with PyList_SetSlice
# https://github.com/tobgu/pyrsistent/pull/284
#
# Together with the 0.20.0 release, this fixes:
#
# python-pyrsistent fails to build with Python 3.13: implicit declaration of
# function ‘Py_TRASHCAN_SAFE_BEGIN’, ‘Py_TRASHCAN_SAFE_END’, ‘_PyList_Extend’
# https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2246349

# Note that pyrsistent/_toolz.py contains a bit of code ported from toolz, but
# not enough to constitute a bundled dependency.

%global common_description %{expand:
Pyrsistent is a number of persistent collections (by some referred to as
functional data structures). Persistent in the sense that they are
immutable.

All methods on a data structure that would normally mutate it instead
return a new copy of the structure containing the requested updates. The
original structure is left untouched.}

#   - pyperform, since we are not running the benchmarks from
#     performance_suites/
#   - tox, since we are not using tox to run the tests
